# DeMod-GTAV
A glorified control click delete quickly built up as a program out of the rage I had when forgetting what files are supposed to be in the GTAV directory

## Developer
Even though there is a wide range of problems with this program, don't make pull requests. Fork the repository if you wish to improve it.
#### Some Suggestions for improvement
* Optimize import usages
* Check for out of place files inside folders (Right now the program only checks in the root directory of GTAV)
* CLEAN UP THE CODE FOR FUCK SAKE! Looks like modern art in here with all the stackoverflow answers splashed everywhere
