# DeMod-GTAV
A glorified control click delete quickly built up as a program out of the rage I had when forgetting what files are supposed to be in the GTAV directory

## Developer
Don't judge the code people. There are a least a 100 things that need to be changed about this program ranging from imports to variable names; however, this was soley made for the action of removing mods from GTAV and not to be anywhere near perfect.
This is a public repo because it was the easiest way to consistently move the program amoung local machines.
