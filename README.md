# DeMod-GTAV
A glorified control click delete quickly built up as a program out of the rage I had when forgetting what files are supposed to be in the GTAV directory

You can download the executable [here](https://github.com/Trogiken/DeMod-GTAV/releases/download/1.6.21/DeModGTAV.exe)

* Commit Info: 
It will be rare if I allow anyone to merge into the master branch. There are a least a 100 things that need to be changed about this program ranging from imports to variable names; however, this was soley made for the simple action of removing mods from GTAV and not made to be a professional piece of software.
